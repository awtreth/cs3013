Version:					1.0
Project ID:					Project 1
CS Class:					CS 3013 (Operating Systems)
Programming Language:		C
How to build the program:	make all
How to test:			./runCommand [shell commands]
				./shell < [input file] (Ex: input_test.txt)
				./shell
					then enter commands (special built-in commands: 'exit' and 'cd')
				







OS/Hardware dependencies:	how does the program rely on the operating system,
				   or on the hardware?

Problem Description:		Develop a shell

Overall Design:			main design decisions about the program
